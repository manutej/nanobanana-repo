Create a geometric-philosophical symbolic visualization titled "SURFACE LIMITS DEFINITION OF SIZE OF FORM"

How surface defines form's boundary and determines its scale in space.

Visual Elements:
- Platonic solids showing surface defining volume:
  - Tetrahedron (4 triangular faces)
  - Cube (6 square faces)
  - Octahedron (8 triangular faces)
  - Dodecahedron (12 pentagonal faces)
  - Icosahedron (20 triangular faces)

SURFACE AS LIMIT:
- Interior: Undefined potential (volume without form)
- Surface: Defining boundary (limit creating definition)
- Exterior: Everything else (context, environment)
- Surface is both boundary AND interface

Mathematical Relationships:
- Surface area vs. Volume: Different scaling (A ∝ r², V ∝ r³)
- Square-cube law: Why giants collapse (surface/volume ratio)
- Minimal surfaces: Soap bubbles (least area for volume)
- Isoperimetric problem: Circle has maximum area for perimeter

SIZE DETERMINATION:
- Small forms: Surface dominates (microbes, insects)
- Large forms: Volume dominates (elephants, whales)
- Surface-to-volume ratio determines:
  - Heat loss rate
  - Nutrient exchange efficiency
  - Structural requirements
  - Possible size range

Natural Examples:
- Cell size limited by surface area (diffusion constraint)
- Tree height limited by surface tension (water transport)
- Animal size limited by square-cube law (structural limits)
- Lung alveoli: Maximizing surface (internal surface solution)

Philosophical Dimension:
- Form requires limitation (infinite has no shape)
- Surface as membrane between self and other
- Definition IS limitation (to define is to confine)
- Size follows function (form follows surface-volume constraints)

Visual Metaphors:
- Balloon inflating: Surface stretching, volume increasing
- Fractal coastline: Surface area indeterminate at small scale
- Möbius strip: Surface without inside/outside
- Klein bottle: Surface folding through itself

Color Palette:
- Surface: Bright defining colors (boundaries visible)
- Interior: Soft diffuse colors (undefined space)
- Exterior: Context gradients (environmental field)
- Platonic solids: Sacred geometry colors
- Mathematical mesh: Precision blue-gray

Style: Geometric proof meets philosophical meditation
Mood: Definition through limitation, form through boundary
Composition: Nested surfaces showing scale relationships

Teaching: Surface is not passive wrapper - it actively LIMITS and thereby DEFINES form. Size is determined by surface-volume interplay. Limits create definition.
