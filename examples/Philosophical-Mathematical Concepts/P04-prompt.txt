Create an alchemical symbolic visualization titled "SOLVE ET COAGULA - Dissolve and Coagulate"

The fundamental alchemical operation: dissolution followed by crystallization.

Visual Elements:
LEFT SIDE - SOLVE (Dissolution):
- Solid form breaking into particles
- Upward-pointing triangle △ (fire element, volatilization)
- Ascending vapor, sublimation clouds
- Scattered chaos - prima materia liberated
- Calcination flames, purification fire
- Albedo (whitening) process visible

RIGHT SIDE - COAGULA (Coagulation):
- Particles organizing into perfect crystal structure
- Downward-pointing triangle ▽ (water element, condensation)
- Descending dew, precipitation
- Ordered unity - philosopher's stone forming
- Sacred geometry emerging from chaos
- Rubedo (reddening) final stage

CENTER - TRANSFORMATION AXIS:
- Caduceus staff with intertwined serpents (solve/coagula interplay)
- Hermetic balance point: As above, so below
- Phoenix rising from ashes (complete cycle)
- Alchemical color stages: Nigredo → Albedo → Citrinitas → Rubedo
- Mercurial axis connecting dissolution to crystallization

Color Palette:
- Left: Blacks, grays, whites (calcination, purification)
- Right: Golds, crimsons, purples (perfection achieved)
- Center: Full alchemical color spectrum
- Metallic accents (transformation metals)

Style: Classical alchemical emblem meets dynamic process diagram
Mood: Cyclic transformation, hermetic balance, perfection through dissolution
Composition: Symmetrical duality unified through central axis

Teaching: Solve et Coagula - break down to purify, rebuild to perfect. Spiritual ascent requires material descent. The Great Work.
