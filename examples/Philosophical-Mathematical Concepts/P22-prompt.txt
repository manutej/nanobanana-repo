Create a mathematical-philosophical symbolic visualization titled "THE NUMBER LINE IS MOVEMENT - Geometric Genesis of Number"

Number line as dynamic process, not static diagram - number as motion through space.

Visual Elements:
- Number line beginning at origin (zero point)
- Each number generated by MOVEMENT from zero:
  - 1: One unit movement right from 0
  - 2: Two unit movements (1+1 succession)
  - 3: Three movements (counting as motion)
  - Negatives: Movement left from 0

- Movement as generator of number, not number enabling movement
- Geometric construction: Compass and straightedge creating numbers
- Each number is frozen moment in continuous motion

MOVEMENT DYNAMICS:
- Zero: Stillness, potentiality (no movement yet)
- Positive integers: Rightward steps (discrete movement)
- Negative integers: Leftward steps (opposite direction)
- Rational numbers: Fractional steps (subdivided movement)
- Irrational numbers: Incommensurable movements (√2, π, e, Φ)
- Continuous line: Infinite potential movements

Philosophical Depth:
- Number doesn't exist independently - it IS the movement
- Counting is temporal succession (movement through time)
- Geometric construction is spatial movement (compass/ruler motion)
- Time and number are co-emergent from movement
- Static number line is abstraction of dynamic process

Visual Progression:
1. Point (zero) - no movement, pure potential
2. First movement - creating unit (1)
3. Repetition - successor function (1,2,3...)
4. Reversal - negative numbers (-1,-2,-3...)
5. Subdivision - rationals (1/2, 1/3, 2/3...)
6. Incommensurable - irrationals (√2, π...)
7. Limit - reals (continuous movement)

Geometric Constructions:
- Unit circle: Rotational movement creating trigonometry
- Spiral: Outward movement creating logarithmic scale
- Number line doubling: Each number contains entire line (fractal)
- Geometric series: Movement by ratio (Φ, 2, e)

Physical Metaphors:
- Pendulum swing: Periodic movement creating rhythm
- Particle trajectory: Movement tracing number positions
- Wave propagation: Continuous movement through medium
- Quantum walk: Probabilistic movement creating distribution

Temporal Aspect:
- Counting requires TIME (successive enumeration)
- Number line is TIME spatialized
- Derivative: Instantaneous movement (velocity)
- Integral: Accumulated movement (distance)

Color Palette:
- Zero: White point (stillness)
- Positive direction: Warm colors (red→orange→yellow)
- Negative direction: Cool colors (blue→purple→indigo)
- Movement trails: Motion blur effects
- Irrationals: Shimmering, non-repeating patterns
- Background: Spacetime gradient

Style: Dynamic mathematics - number as active process
Mood: Movement as foundation, number as frozen motion
Composition: Number line with visible movement vectors, traces, and generation process

Teaching: Number line is not passive diagram - it IS movement. Each number represents specific movement from origin. Mathematics is study of possible movements, not static entities.
