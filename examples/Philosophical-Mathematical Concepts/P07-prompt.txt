Create a complexity science symbolic visualization titled "SIMPLE PROGRAMS, NATURAL COMPLEXITY TEACHER"

How the simplest programs generate the complexity we see in nature.

Visual Elements:
- Minimal program code (< 5 lines) at top center
- Explosion of complexity radiating outward from simple rule
- Examples of complexity from simple rules:
  - Cellular automaton Rule 30 (chaotic randomness from deterministic rule)
  - Conway's Game of Life gliders and oscillators
  - Fractal patterns (Mandelbrot set from z → z² + c)
  - Shell patterns (cone snails following simple growth rules)
  - Spiral galaxies from gravitational equations
  - Snowflake branching from crystal lattice rules

- IRREDUCIBILITY: Cannot predict outcome without running full computation
- Emergence pathway: Rule → Iteration → Pattern → Complexity
- Computational Universe concept: Nature runs simple programs
- Self-organization from minimal instructions

Visual Progression:
- Center: Single simple rule (equation or algorithm)
- First ring: Initial iterations (steps 1-10)
- Middle ring: Pattern emergence (steps 100-1000)
- Outer ring: Full complexity (natural-looking patterns)

Color Palette:
- Stark black/white for cellular automata
- Natural colors for organic examples (shells, snowflakes)
- Mathematical blue for fractals
- Cosmic purples for emergence visualization
- Golden highlights showing key iteration points

Style: Computer science meets natural history - algorithm as genesis
Mood: Wonder at simplicity generating complexity, computational universe
Composition: Central rule radiating into natural complexity

Teaching: Nature's complexity doesn't require complex mechanisms. Simple programs, iterated, generate all the richness we observe. The universe is computable.
