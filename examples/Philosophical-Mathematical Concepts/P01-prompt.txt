Create an abstract symbolic visualization titled "THE UNITY - Indivisible Cosmic Consciousness"

Based on Schwaller de Lubicz's Temple of Man principle of absolute unity.

Visual Elements:
- Central radiating point: THE ONE - source of all existence
- Perfect mandala symmetry representing INDIVISIBLE UNITY
- Golden spiral (Fibonacci) showing VERB evolution through consciousness
- Geometric web connecting all points: COSMIC MAN binding all to all
- Each node responsible for the whole (fractal self-similarity)
- Sacred geometry: Flower of Life, Metatron's Cube, platonic solids nested
- NUMBER as pure science: Pythagorean ratios visible (1:2:3:4 octave harmonics)
- SYMBOL language: Hieroglyphic characters flowing through structure
- HARMONY emerging from DISORDER: chaotic periphery coalescing into central order
- Alpha-Omega: Spirit at beginning and end of all form
- Form follows function: Each geometric shape serves purpose

Color Palette:
- Deep cosmic violet-indigo (primordial consciousness)
- Sacred gold (divine wisdom, Φ proportion)
- Pure white radiance at center (source)
- Iridescent transitions (consciousness evolution)
- Sapphire blue (celestial harmony)

Style: Sacred geometry meets cosmic diagram - Pythagorean wisdom visualized
Mood: Transcendent unity, mathematical perfection, wholeness
Composition: Perfect radial symmetry with dynamic spiral evolution from center

Teaching: One sole Truth, One sole Reality, One sole Consciousness - all multiplicity is illusion of the One.
