Create a quantum physics symbolic visualization titled "QUANTUM PARADOX TEACHER - Superposition & Observation"

The fundamental paradoxes of quantum mechanics made visually accessible.

Visual Elements:
- Schrödinger's Cat superposition: Cat both alive and dead simultaneously
- Wave-particle duality: Photon as both wave and particle
- Double-slit experiment: Single electron interfering with itself
- Quantum entanglement: Two particles connected across space
- Observer effect: Measurement collapsing wave function
- Heisenberg uncertainty: Position/momentum complementarity
- Quantum tunneling: Particle passing through classically forbidden barrier

SUPERPOSITION VISUALIZATION:
- Overlapping translucent states
- Wave function ψ showing probability amplitudes
- Multiple realities existing simultaneously
- Measurement apparatus causing collapse

PARADOX ELEMENTS:
- Before observation: Fuzzy superposed states
- During measurement: Wave function collapse
- After observation: Single definite state
- Information loss in collapse (entropy increase)

Symbolic Representations:
- |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ (superposition notation)
- Probability density clouds
- Bloch sphere showing qubit states
- Feynman path integral (all paths taken)

Color Palette:
- Quantum blues and cyans (wave function)
- Probability purples (uncertain states)
- Collapse red (measurement/observation)
- Entanglement gold threads
- Uncertainty gray gradients

Style: Quantum mechanics visualization meets philosophical puzzle
Mood: Mysterious, counterintuitive, reality-challenging
Composition: Superposition center, observation effects radiating

Teaching: Quantum paradoxes - nature is fundamentally probabilistic. Observer and observed cannot be separated. Reality is participatory.
