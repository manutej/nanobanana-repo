Create a sacred geometry symbolic visualization titled "Φ-1 DISPERSAL - Golden Ratio Expansion"

The action of Φ-1 (Phi minus one) representing dispersal, divergence, and evolution.

Visual Elements:
- Golden spiral (Φ-based) spiraling OUTWARD from center point
- Φ-1 = (1.618... - 1) = 0.618... = 1/Φ marked prominently
- Fibonacci sequence expanding: Center → 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89... outward
- Golden rectangles expanding outward (each larger by factor of Φ)
- Divergence arrows pointing away from center
- Mathematical: Φ-1 = 1/Φ property visualized (reciprocal relationship)
- Galaxy spiral arms expanding
- Tree branches following Φ growth pattern
- Energy dispersal: Concentrated center → Diffuse periphery
- Evolution symbolism: Matter rising back to spirit

DISPERSAL DYNAMICS:
- Center point: Compressed potential, seed
- Spiraling outward: Unfolding, expansion, manifestation
- Outer edges: Full expression, differentiation, multiplicity

Sacred Geometry Elements:
- Pentagon/pentagram showing outward Φ proportions
- Logarithmic growth spiral
- Phyllotaxis: Leaf/petal arrangement expanding
- Chambered nautilus: Outward growth chambers

Mathematical Relationships:
- Φ × (Φ-1) = 1 (demonstrated visually)
- Golden angle rotation: 137.5° expansion
- Self-similar expansion at every scale

Color Palette:
- Sacred gold (Φ foundation)
- Lightening outward (bright center to soft edges)
- Cool colors (blues, greens dispersing)
- Rainbow spectrum at periphery (differentiation)
- White radiance at source

Style: Sacred geometry meets organic growth patterns
Mood: Expansion, dispersal, sacred evolution
Composition: Outward spiral dynamics, periphery-focused growth

Teaching: Φ-1 as DISPERSAL - the golden ratio minus unity creates divergence. Energy expanding, manifestation unfolding, actual becoming potential. Sacred mathematics of evolution.
