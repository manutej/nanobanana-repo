Create a mathematical-aesthetic symbolic visualization titled "(√5+1)/2 - The Golden Ratio Formula"

The exact mathematical expression of Φ and its profound symbolic significance.

Visual Elements:
- Central equation: Φ = (√5 + 1)/2 = 1.618033988749...
- √5 component visualized: Pentagon with diagonal showing √5 relationship
- Unit square with √5 diagonal construction
- Geometric proof of formula using pentagon/pentagram
- Infinite decimal expansion spiraling outward: 1.618033988749894848204586...
- Visual breakdown:
  - √5 ≈ 2.236... shown as geometric construction
  - Adding 1 to create numerator
  - Dividing by 2 to achieve balance

SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE:
- √5 connects to pentagon (5-fold symmetry)
- Life's spiral (5 petals, 5 fingers, pentagon flowers)
- Irrational yet constructible (geometric perfection)
- Self-referential: Φ = 1 + 1/Φ
- Continued fraction showing infinite self-reference
- Nature's optimization: Most efficient packing, growth pattern

Mathematical Beauty:
- Φ² = Φ + 1 (unique property)
- 1/Φ = Φ - 1 (reciprocal magic)
- Fibonacci limit: lim(F_{n+1}/F_n) = Φ
- Golden angle: 360°/Φ² = 137.5°

Visual Examples:
- Nautilus shell spiral (Φ growth)
- Galaxy arms (logarithmic Φ spiral)
- Flower petal arrangements (Φ angle)
- Human body proportions (Φ ratios)
- Parthenon architecture (Φ rectangle)

Color Palette:
- Mathematical black precise lines
- Sacred gold highlighting Φ
- Geometric construction in blues
- Irrational spiral in purples
- Natural examples in earth tones

Style: Mathematical precision meets aesthetic reverence
Mood: Wonder at mathematical perfection, nature's signature
Composition: Central formula radiating into geometric proof and natural applications

Teaching: (√5+1)/2 is not arbitrary - it's the most irrational number, maximally resistant to rational approximation. Nature uses it for optimal efficiency.
