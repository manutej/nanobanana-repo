Create a mathematical-mystical symbolic visualization titled "GENESIS OF Φ+1 - Birth of the Golden Mean"

How Φ+1 arises from the fundamental relationship of unity and division.

Visual Elements:
- Starting point: Unity (1) shown as perfect circle
- Division: 1 dividing itself to create Φ relationship
- Golden cut: Line segment divided in Φ proportion
- Visual proof: a/b = b/(a+b) = Φ
- Pentagon construction showing Φ emergence
- Fibonacci spiral forming from recursive subdivision
- Genesis sequence:
  1. Unity (the One)
  2. Division (creating ratio)
  3. Φ emerges (1.618033988...)
  4. Φ+1 = Φ² revelation

MATHEMATICAL GENESIS:
- Quadratic equation: x² - x - 1 = 0 solving to x = Φ
- Continued fraction: 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/...)) = Φ
- Property demonstration: Φ + 1 = Φ²
- Visual: Rectangle dividing into square + golden rectangle recursively

Sacred Geometry Birth:
- Pentagon forms showing Φ in diagonals
- Pentagram with Φ ratios everywhere
- Golden triangles (36°-72°-72°)
- Vesica piscis generating Φ proportions

Symbolic Layers:
- Unity seeking relationship with itself
- Self-referential mathematics (Φ = 1 + 1/Φ)
- Recursion creating transcendence
- Irrational number from rational process

Color Palette:
- Pure white (unity at origin)
- Emerging gold (Φ revelation)
- Sacred geometry blues
- Mathematical precision black lines
- Radiant illumination at Φ+1 = Φ² discovery

Style: Mathematical revelation meets mystical genesis
Mood: Wonder at mathematical birth, sacred proportion emerging
Composition: Unity dividing into Φ, then Φ+1 formation

Teaching: Φ+1 doesn't come from outside - it arises from unity dividing itself in the most harmonious way possible. Sacred mathematics as self-revelation.
