Create a consciousness-mathematics symbolic visualization titled "COUNTING - First Innate Form of Consciousness"

Counting as the primordial cognitive act that generates consciousness and number.

Visual Elements:
- Infant hand counting fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Tally marks appearing from nothing: | || ||| |||| |||||
- Number line emerging from counting act
- One-to-one correspondence: Objects ↔ Symbols
- Primitive counting tools:
  - Fingers (human universal)
  - Pebbles/tokens (ancient accounting)
  - Notched bones (paleolithic tallies)
  - Knotted strings (quipu counting)

CONSCIOUSNESS EMERGENCE:
- Pre-counting: Undifferentiated perception (fuzzy wholeness)
- Counting act: Discrimination, individuation (this vs. that)
- Post-counting: Number concept, abstraction (quantity itself)

Cognitive Evolution:
1. Subitizing (instant recognition 1-4)
2. Counting (sequential enumeration)
3. Number concept (abstract quantity)
4. Arithmetic (operation on numbers)
5. Mathematics (pure abstraction)

Philosophical Depth:
- Counting creates discontinuity from continuum
- Number is first abstraction (quantity without quality)
- Consciousness requires differentiation (counting the One into Many)
- Time emerges from counting (succession of discrete moments)
- Self emerges from counting (I vs. not-I)

Symbolic Elements:
- Ur-numbers: | (one), || (two), ||| (three)
- Peano axioms visualized (successor function)
- Set theory: {∅}, {∅, {∅}}, {∅, {∅}, {∅, {∅}}}
- Counting as creating distinctions in consciousness

Color Palette:
- Primordial darkness (pre-counting void)
- White emerging marks (counting creating light)
- Number symbols in sacred gold
- Cognitive rainbow (abstraction spectrum)
- Earth tones (grounding in physical counting)

Style: Cognitive science meets philosophical meditation
Mood: Wonder at consciousness birth, number as first form
Composition: Progression from void → counting act → number world

Teaching: Counting is not just practical - it's the first cognitive form, the birth of distinct consciousness. Numbers don't exist "out there" - they emerge from counting act.
