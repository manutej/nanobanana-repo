Create a neurobiological-mystical symbolic visualization titled "GLANDS OF ENCEPHALON - Pineal, Pituitary, Hypothalamus"

The master endocrine glands of the brain as consciousness regulators and mystical centers.

Visual Elements:
- Brain cross-section showing Third Ventricle region
- Three sacred glands highlighted:

PINEAL GLAND (Epiphysis):
- Pinecone-shaped (sacred geometry)
- Melatonin secretion (circadian rhythm, DMT speculation)
- Third Eye position (ajna chakra)
- Calcite crystals (piezoelectric properties)
- Light sensitivity despite being buried deep

PITUITARY GLAND (Hypophysis):
- Master gland (orchestrating endocrine system)
- Anterior/posterior lobes
- Growth hormone, reproductive hormones
- Crown chakra association (sahasrara)

HYPOTHALAMUS:
- Master regulator above pituitary
- Autonomic nervous system control
- Homeostasis center
- Sleep/wake, hunger/satiety, temperature

MYSTICAL CORRESPONDENCE:
- Pineal: Spiritual perception, cosmic consciousness
- Pituitary: Command center, master coordination
- Hypothalamus: Life force, autonomic wisdom
- Trinity: Father (hypothalamus), Son (pituitary), Holy Spirit (pineal)

Esoteric Symbolism:
- Third Eye seeing beyond material
- Philosopher's Stone location (alchemical brain)
- Seat of Soul (Descartes' proposal)
- Kundalini endpoint (serpent power rising)
- Cosmic antenna (receiving celestial influences)

Biological Functions:
- Hormonal cascades illustrated
- Circadian rhythm wheel (24-hour cycle)
- Feedback loops between glands
- Blood-brain barrier context
- Ventricular system (cerebrospinal fluid)

Color Palette:
- Brain tissue grays and pinks
- Pineal: Indigo/violet (third eye)
- Pituitary: Golden (master gland)
- Hypothalamus: Red/orange (life force)
- Hormones: Rainbow biochemical messengers
- Mystical light: White radiance from glands

Style: Anatomical precision meets esoteric mysticism
Mood: Reverence for biological wisdom, consciousness mystery
Composition: Brain cross-section with gland trinity highlighted and mystically illuminated

Teaching: Encephalon glands - biological consciousness regulators that ancient traditions knew as mystical centers. Science and spirituality converge in neurobiology.
