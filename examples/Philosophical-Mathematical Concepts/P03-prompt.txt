Create a mystical symbolic visualization titled "SPIRITUS DOMINI FEREBATUR SUPER AQUAS - Divine Spirit Upon Waters"

Genesis 1:2 - The moment before creation, spirit hovering over formless deep.

Visual Elements:
- Lower half: Primordial waters (tohu wa-bohu) - dark, formless, infinite potential
- Upper half: Ruach Elohim (Spirit of God) - luminous breath/wind descending
- Interface: Shimmering membrane where spirit touches matter
- Dove descending (traditional pneuma symbol)
- Subtle light emerging from darkness (pre-Fiat Lux moment)
- Wave patterns: Spirit vibrating matter into readiness for form
- Hebrew letters אלהים (Elohim) emerging from the boundary
- Cosmic egg cracking at edges - birth of creation imminent
- Formless chaos below organizing into potential order above
- Wind/breath spirals (Ruach = wind/spirit/breath in Hebrew)

Color Palette:
- Deep primordial blacks and indigos (unmanifest waters)
- Brilliant whites and golds (divine spirit descending)
- Iridescent boundary (spirit-matter interface)
- Twilight purples and blues (liminal pre-creation)
- Subtle rainbow refraction (light ready to differentiate)

Style: Biblical mysticism meets cosmic abstraction - creation theology visualized
Mood: Primordial stillness, divine immanence, pregnant potential
Composition: Horizontal division with dynamic interaction at boundary

Teaching: And the Spirit of the LORD moved upon the face of the waters - pure consciousness touching pure potential, the breath before the Word.
