Create a mathematical-aesthetic symbolic visualization titled "1:1/Φ:Φ² - Golden Ratio Triad"

The fundamental proportion 1 : 1/Φ : Φ² and its geometric/aesthetic significance.

Visual Elements:
- Three segments in golden proportion:
  - Segment 1: Length = 1 (unity, baseline)
  - Segment 2: Length = 1/Φ = 0.618... (golden reciprocal)
  - Segment 3: Length = Φ² = 2.618... (golden square)

- Visual relationship: 1/Φ + 1 = Φ and Φ + 1 = Φ²
- Golden rectangle divisions showing this proportion
- Pentagon with 1:1/Φ:Φ² appearing in sides/diagonals
- Pentagram showing ALL ratios are golden

GEOMETRIC DEMONSTRATIONS:
- Rectangle: Width 1, Height Φ (golden rectangle)
- Dividing creates: Square (1×1) + Rectangle (1/Φ × 1)
- Extended rectangle: 1 + Φ = Φ² width
- Spiral: Each turn grows by Φ factor
- Nautilus chambers: 1, Φ, Φ², Φ³... progression

Mathematical Properties:
- Φ² = Φ + 1 = 2.618...
- 1/Φ = Φ - 1 = 0.618...
- Φ × 1/Φ = 1 (reciprocal identity)
- 1 : 0.618 : 2.618 (fundamental triad)
- Geometric mean: √(1 × Φ²) = Φ

Aesthetic Applications:
- Classical architecture: Parthenon proportions (1:1/Φ:Φ²)
- Renaissance art: Canvas proportions, composition divisions
- Musical harmony: Octave divisions approaching Φ ratios
- Human body: Navel divides height in ~1:1/Φ ratio
- Face: Eye-to-chin vs. top-to-eyes ≈ Φ ratio

Natural Occurrences:
- Flower petals: Counts follow Fibonacci (approaching Φ ratios)
- Tree branches: Division points at 1/Φ proportion
- Spiral galaxies: Arms at Φ angle spacing
- DNA helix: Turn ratio related to Φ
- Solar system: Planetary orbit ratios approximating Φ

Visual Composition:
- Three nested rectangles: 1, 1/Φ, Φ² widths
- Golden spiral connecting proportion points
- Pentagon/pentagram showing all three ratios
- Musical staff with Φ-based intervals
- Human form with proportion markers

Color Palette:
- Segment 1: Pure white (unity)
- Segment 1/Φ: Sacred gold (0.618...)
- Segment Φ²: Deep gold (2.618...)
- Connecting lines: Mathematical blue
- Background: Harmonic gradients
- Aesthetic examples: Natural earth tones

Style: Mathematical precision meets aesthetic perfection
Mood: Harmony, proportion, beauty through mathematics
Composition: Three segments in golden relationship, radiating into applications

Teaching: 1:1/Φ:Φ² is THE fundamental proportion - appearing in pentagon, rectangle, spiral, nature, art, and music. Beauty has mathematical structure.
