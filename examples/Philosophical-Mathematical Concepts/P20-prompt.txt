Create a dimensional-geometric symbolic visualization titled "FIRST LIMITATION - The Ternary Axle System"

The three-axis coordinate system as the first fundamental limitation creating spatial form.

Visual Elements:
- Three perpendicular axes emerging from origin:
  - X-axis (red): Left-right, width, horizontal
  - Y-axis (green): Forward-back, depth, sagittal
  - Z-axis (blue): Up-down, height, vertical

- Origin point (0,0,0): Primordial zero, source of coordinates
- Octants: Eight regions created by three axes
- Coordinate planes: XY, XZ, YZ (three intersecting planes)

TERNARY AS LIMITATION:
- Zero-dimensional: Point (no limitation, pure potential)
- One-dimensional: Line (first limitation, one degree of freedom)
- Two-dimensional: Plane (second limitation, two degrees)
- Three-dimensional: Space (ternary limitation, our experienced world)
- Four+: Hyperspace (beyond immediate limitation)

Sacred Geometry of Three:
- Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Spirit
- Body, Mind, Spirit
- Past, Present, Future
- Birth, Life, Death
- Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis

Spatial Consequences:
- Three is MINIMUM for stable structure (triangle, tripod)
- Three axes define all positions in our space
- Three is MAXIMUM for mutually perpendicular lines
- Three determines handedness (right-hand rule)

Visual Demonstrations:
- Cube construction from three axes
- Sphere defined by three-axis distance
- Cartesian grid extending infinitely
- Vector decomposition into three components
- Cross product creating third perpendicular vector

Philosophical Dimension:
- Why three? Why not two or four?
- Three creates VOLUME (inhabited space)
- Limitation as creation (constraint enables form)
- First limitation = ternary axis system
- All physical form exists within this frame

Color Coding:
- X-axis: Red (width, first extension)
- Y-axis: Green (depth, second extension)
- Z-axis: Blue (height, third extension)
- RGB combined = White (three colors make light)
- Origin: Black to white gradient (emergence)
- Grid lines: Translucent gray (coordinate mesh)

Dimensional Progression:
- 0D: Point (pure potential, no extension)
- 1D: Line (one axis, first limitation)
- 2D: Plane (two axes, second limitation)
- 3D: Space (three axes, TERNARY LIMITATION - we are here)
- 4D+: Hint at higher dimensions (shadow/projection)

Style: Technical coordinate geometry meets philosophical cosmology
Mood: Fundamental limitation enabling all form
Composition: Three axes radiating from origin, creating spatial framework

Teaching: Ternary axle system is FIRST LIMITATION - three perpendicular axes create the possibility of spatial form. Three is minimum for volume, maximum for perpendicularity. Space itself is a limitation.
