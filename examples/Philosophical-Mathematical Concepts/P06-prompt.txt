Create a computational-philosophical symbolic visualization titled "COMPUTATIONAL EQUIVALENCE TEACHER - Universal Complexity"

Wolfram's Principle: Nearly all non-trivial processes reach equivalent computational sophistication.

Visual Elements:
- Grid of 6 computational systems showing equivalent complexity:
  1. Rule 110 cellular automaton (black/white evolving pattern)
  2. Simple Turing machine tape
  3. Natural pattern (snowflake crystal formation)
  4. Economic market price chart
  5. Neural network layers activating
  6. Weather system turbulence

- COMPLEXITY HORIZON: Horizontal line showing all systems reaching same level
- Emergence arrows: Simple rules → Complex behavior in each system
- Class 4 behavior marker: Edge of chaos where universal computation happens
- Turing completeness symbols (❈) marking equivalent systems
- Irreducibility visualization: Cannot shortcut - must run the computation
- Simple starting rules shown for each system (minimal code)

Conceptual Layers (Bottom to Top):
- Elementary rules (deterministic, simple)
- Iterative evolution (time steps, generations)
- Emergent complexity (patterns appearing)
- Computational equivalence plateau (all equally sophisticated)

Color Palette:
- Black and white cellular automata (stark computational clarity)
- Rainbow spectrum differentiating systems
- Golden threads connecting equivalent-complexity points
- Fractal gradients (self-similarity across scales)
- Blue computation glow at equivalence horizon

Style: Scientific data visualization meets philosophical revelation
Mood: Profound equality - simplicity reaches nature's sophistication
Composition: Grid comparison unified by equivalence principle

Teaching: Wolfram's insight - cellular automaton, markets, weather, brains: All reach same computational power. Universe is democratic in complexity.
