Create a physics-biology symbolic visualization titled "QUARK MATTER & PORPHYRINS ELIXIR TEACHER"

Bridging fundamental particles and life's master molecule - matter from quarks to biological function.

Visual Elements:
QUARK LEVEL (Microscopic foundation):
- Three quarks forming proton/neutron
- Quark colors: red, green, blue (color charge, not actual color)
- Gluon exchange (strong force binding quarks)
- Quantum chromodynamics field
- Scale: 10^-15 meters

ATOMIC LEVEL (Iron):
- Iron-56 nucleus (26 protons, 30 neutrons)
- Electron shells showing ferrous (Fe²⁺) state
- Ferromagnetism indicating electron spin
- Scale: 10^-10 meters

MOLECULAR LEVEL (Porphyrin):
- Iron at center of porphyrin ring (heme)
- Tetrapyrrole coordination bonds to Fe²⁺
- Oxygen molecule (O₂) binding site
- Conjugated π-electron system
- Scale: 10^-9 meters

BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION:
- Hemoglobin protein structure
- Oxygen transport through bloodstream
- Life process enabled by fundamental particles

Connecting Threads:
- Matter hierarchy: Quarks → Nucleons → Atoms → Molecules → Life
- Energy scales decreasing upward
- Complexity increasing upward
- Quantum mechanics at base → Classical biology at top

Color Palette:
- Quark level: Quantum color (RGB chromodynamics)
- Atomic: Metallic iron grays and oranges
- Molecular: Deep crimson porphyrin
- Biological: Blood red with oxygen blue

Style: Multi-scale scientific visualization - matter building life
Mood: Awe at continuity from fundamental particles to consciousness
Composition: Vertical scale progression with connecting pathways

Teaching: Life's elixir (porphyrin) is built from fundamental quark matter. From particle physics to breathing - unbroken chain of emergence.
