Create an alchemical symbolic visualization titled "SERVUS FUGITIVUS - The Fugitive Servant"

Traditional alchemical concept of mercury as the elusive transformative agent.

Visual Elements:
- Liquid mercury droplets escaping from alchemical vessels (alembic, retort)
- ☿ Mercury symbol prominent - the servant that flees yet serves
- Quicksilver streams flowing upward (volatile principle ascending)
- Hermetic seals attempting containment but mercury slipping through
- Philosophical fire beneath - gentle controlled heat
- Ouroboros serpent partially broken - escape and eternal return
- Shadow play: Mercury's dual nature (material/spiritual, fixed/volatile)
- Ancient manuscript fragments with red and black alchemical notation
- Glass vessels with silvery reflections and condensation
- Metaphor: The servant must flee to be caught, volatilize to be fixed

Color Palette:
- Metallic silver (liquid mercury shimmer)
- Deep alchemical crimson and gold (transformation)
- Smoky grays and ethereal whites (volatile escape)
- Aged parchment tones (ancient wisdom)
- Subtle green-copper patina (chemical process)

Style: Medieval alchemical manuscript meets fluid dynamics abstraction
Mood: Elusive mystery, transformation through escape, volatile wisdom
Composition: Upward dynamic flow showing containment/escape tension

Teaching: Mercury as Servus Fugitivus - the philosophical servant that serves precisely by fleeing, teaching that transformation requires controlled volatility.
