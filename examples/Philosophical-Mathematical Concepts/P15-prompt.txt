Create a cosmological-philosophical symbolic visualization titled "THE ORIGINAL SCISSION - Polarization of Energy"

The primordial split that creates duality from unity - the first division.

Visual Elements:
- Central point: Original Unity (pregnant void)
- Moment of scission: Splitting into complementary polarities
- Left side: Negative pole (-, yin, feminine, receptive)
- Right side: Positive pole (+, yang, masculine, active)
- Energy field polarizing like magnetic field lines
- Lightning bolt of division: The creative split
- Perfect symmetry: Each pole contains the whole, inverted

POLARIZATION DYNAMICS:
- Before: Undifferentiated potential (tao, pleroma, Ein Sof)
- During: Scission - the original wound/blessing
- After: Polar tension creating manifest universe

Symbolic Dualities:
- Light/Dark (photon/shadow)
- Matter/Antimatter (particle/antiparticle)
- Wave/Particle (quantum duality)
- Space/Time (spacetime fabric)
- Subject/Object (consciousness split)
- Good/Evil (moral polarization)
- Yin/Yang (taoist complementarity)

Scientific Parallels:
- Big Bang: Symmetry breaking
- Electromagnetism: Positive/negative charge
- Quantum field: Particle/hole pairs
- Thermodynamics: Order/entropy
- Biology: Male/female reproduction

Reconciliation Hints:
- Vesica piscis: Overlapping circles (polarity creating sacred geometry)
- Caduceus: Serpents reuniting on staff
- Ouroboros: Circle eating tail (end meeting beginning)
- Androgynous figure: Polarities unified in human

Color Palette:
- Central white: Undivided light
- Left: Cool colors (blues, violets, blacks - yin)
- Right: Warm colors (reds, oranges, whites - yang)
- Scission line: Electric purple/white lightning
- Vesica overlap: Rainbow spectrum (unity in division)

Style: Cosmological diagram meets mystical theology
Mood: Primordial drama, creative tension, necessary division
Composition: Central scission radiating into polarized universe

Teaching: Original Scission - unity must divide to know itself. Consciousness requires subject/object split. Creation is polarization. All multiplicity flows from primordial duality.
