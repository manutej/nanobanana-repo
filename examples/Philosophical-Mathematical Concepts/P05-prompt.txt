Create a biochemical-mystical symbolic visualization titled "PORPHYRINS ELIXIR TEACHER - Sound & Light Activation of Life"

Porphyrin tetrapyrrole ring as master molecule activated by vibration and photons.

Visual Elements:
- Central porphyrin macrocycle: Four pyrrole rings in perfect square symmetry
- Metal center (Fe for hemoglobin, Mg for chlorophyll) glowing
- Conjugated double bond system shown as electron probability clouds
- SOUND ACTIVATION: Cymatics wave patterns overlaying molecular structure
- LIGHT ACTIVATION: Photon arrows striking conjugated system
- Quantum energy level diagram: Absorption/emission transitions
- Hemoglobin (red, oxygen transport) | Chlorophyll (green, photosynthesis) side-by-side
- Resonance frequencies: Standing waves matching molecular geometry
- Sacred geometry emerging from tetrapyrrole 4-fold symmetry
- Vibrational nodes matching molecular orbital patterns
- Light rays: Red (Soret band ~400nm), Green-Blue (Q bands 500-600nm)

Color Palette:
- Deep blood crimson (hemoglobin, life force)
- Vibrant chlorophyll green (photosynthesis, plant life)
- Golden yellows (bilirubin, transformation product)
- Iridescent purples (porphyrin π-electron resonance)
- White/cyan light rays (photon activation)
- Sound: Visible cymatics patterns in blues

Style: Molecular visualization meets mystical sacred geometry
Mood: Teaching reverence - molecules as wisdom teachers
Composition: Molecular structure central, activation vectors radiating

Teaching: Porphyrins as ELIXIR - light (photons) and sound (vibration) activate the tetrapyrrole structure that powers all life. Blood and leaf share the same master molecule.
