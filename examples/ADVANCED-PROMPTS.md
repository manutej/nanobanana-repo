## Expected Enhancements

### Example 11 (Food Photography)

**Original** (37 words):
```
Gourmet pasta carbonara being twirled on a fork with steam rising,
captured mid-action with dramatic side lighting and shallow depth of
field, professional food photography for Michelin restaurant menu
```

**Enhanced** (expected ~120 words):
```

macro lens, ISO 100, tethered shooting workflow, professional food styling
with garnish placement, dramatic Rembrandt lighting from 45-degree side angle,
diffused softbox key light, black bounce cards for negative fill, captured
at 1/250s to freeze motion while maintaining steam visibility, focus
stacked (5 exposures) for fork tines to pasta strands depth, professional
color grading emphasizing golden carbonara tones and green basil garnish,
ultra-high resolution detail capture of sauce texture and steam wisps,

## Template Challenge Cases

### Challenge 1: Event-Driven Sequence Diagram

**Issue**: Current templates don't have sequence diagram subcategory
**Solution**: Apply flowchart template but needs sequence-specific enhancements:
- Lifeline notation
- Asynchronous message arrows
- Activation boxes
- Return messages

### Challenge 2: Mixed Media Art

**Issue**: No mixed_media subcategory in art domain
**Solution**: Apply abstract or digital_art template with custom enhancements:
- Collage composition techniques
- Texture layering
- Historical art movement references

### Challenge 3: Responsive Wireframes

**Issue**: Single breakpoint wireframe vs multi-breakpoint comparison
**Solution**: Template needs to emphasize:
- Side-by-side layout
- Breakpoint labels
- Responsive flow indicators
