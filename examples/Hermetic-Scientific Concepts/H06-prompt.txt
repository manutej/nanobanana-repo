Create a computational-philosophical symbolic visualization titled "COMPUTATIONAL EQUIVALENCE TEACHER - Wolfram's Principle"

Visual Elements:
- Multiple computational systems side-by-side showing equivalent complexity:
  - Rule 110 cellular automaton evolving
  - Simple Turing machine computation
  - Natural system (snowflake formation, shell pattern)
  - Economic market dynamics
  - Neural network learning
  - Weather system evolution

- Unified complexity horizon: all systems reaching same computational power
- Emergence patterns: simple rules → complex behavior across all domains
- Irreducibility visualization: no shortcuts - must run computation to see result
- Class 4 behavior: edge of chaos where computation happens
- Universal computation symbols (Turing completeness markers)

Conceptual Layers:
- Bottom: Elementary rules (simple, deterministic)
- Middle: Evolutionary process (iteration, emergence)
- Top: Computational equivalence (all equally complex)

Color Palette:
- Black and white cellular automata (stark rule-based dynamics)
- Rainbow spectrum for different computational systems
- Golden threads connecting equivalent systems
- Fractal color gradients (self-similarity across scales)

Style: Scientific data visualization meets philosophical diagram
Mood: Profound equality - simple rules can match nature's complexity
Composition: Grid-like comparison showing diverse systems unified by principle

Teacher Concept: Wolfram's Principle of Computational Equivalence - nearly all processes that aren't obviously simple are of equivalent sophistication. Universe computes, mind computes, markets compute - all reaching same computational threshold. Irreducibility means: you must live the experiment.
