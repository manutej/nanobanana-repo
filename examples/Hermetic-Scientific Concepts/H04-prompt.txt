Create an alchemical symbolic visualization titled "SOLVE ET COAGULA - Dissolve and Coagulate"

Visual Elements:
- Left side: SOLVE - dissolution, breaking down, analysis
  - Solid form fragmenting into particles
  - Ascending vapor, sublimation, spiritual ascent
  - Upward-pointing triangle (fire, volatilization)
  - Chaotic scatter representing prima materia freed

- Right side: COAGULA - coagulation, synthesis, reunification
  - Particles crystallizing into new perfect form
  - Descending dew, condensation, material descent
  - Downward-pointing triangle (water, fixation)
  - Ordered structure representing philosopher's stone

- Center: Dynamic transformation zone
  - Alchemical symbols for stages: nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, rubedo
  - Hermetic balance point - as above, so below
  - Caduceus intertwining solve and coagula
  - Phoenix rising from ashes (transformation complete)

Color Palette:
- Left: Blacks, grays, whites (dissolution, calcination)
- Right: Golds, crimsons, purples (coagulation, perfection)
- Center: Rainbow spectrum (all stages visible)
- Alchemical color progression integrated throughout

Style: Classical alchemical emblem meets modern abstract dynamics
Mood: Transformation, cyclic perfection, hermetic wisdom
Composition: Symmetrical yet dynamic - eternal process visualized

The Great Work: Through dissolution we purify, through coagulation we perfect. Spiritual ascent and material descent unified.
