Create a biochemical-mystical symbolic visualization titled "PORPHYRINS ELIXIR TEACHER - Light-Sound Activation"

Visual Elements:
- Central porphyrin ring structure: tetrapyrrole macrocycle with metal center (Fe/Mg)
- Molecular geometry: precise aromatic resonance, conjugated double bonds
- Sound activation: cymatics wave patterns overlaying molecular structure
- Light activation: photon absorption arrows, quantum energy level transitions
- Hemoglobin and chlorophyll structural comparison side-by-side
- Color-coded activation pathways:
  - Red light → oxygen transport (blood)
  - Green/blue light → photosynthesis (plants)
- Resonance frequencies visualized as standing wave harmonics
- Quantum coherence: electron delocalization shown as probability clouds
- Sacred geometry emerging from molecular symmetry (4-fold, 5-fold patterns)

Color Palette:
- Deep crimson reds (hemoglobin, life blood)
- Vibrant chlorophyll greens (plant life, photosynthesis)
- Golden yellow (bilirubin, transformation)
- Iridescent purples (porphyrin ring resonance)
- White/cyan light rays (photon activation)

Style: Scientific molecular visualization meets mystical sacred geometry
Mood: Teaching tool - reverence for molecular wisdom, light-life connection
Composition: Molecular structure central, activation vectors radiating outward

Teacher Concept: Porphyrins as master molecules - teaching us how sound (vibration) and light (photons) activate life's core functions. The elixir of vitality encoded in tetrapyrrole structure.
