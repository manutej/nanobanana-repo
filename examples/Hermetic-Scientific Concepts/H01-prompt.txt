Create an abstract symbolic visualization titled "THE UNITY - Indivisible Consciousness"

Visual Elements:
- Central cosmic mandala representing ONE SOLE TRUTH - perfect radial symmetry
- Golden spiral emanating from center showing VERB evolution in consciousness
- Geometric lattice connecting all points symbolizing COSMIC MAN binding all to all
- Sacred geometry: nested circles, vesica piscis, and platonic solids
- Symbol system: hieratic characters flowing through the structure
- Harmonic wave patterns showing HARMONY emerging from DISORDER
- Numbers integrated as pure science (Pythagorean ratios visible in proportions)
- Beginning and end unified: Alpha-Omega symbolism

Color Palette:
- Deep cosmic indigo background (universal consciousness)
- Golden threads (divine light, wisdom)
- White radiance at center (spirit at origin)
- Iridescent transitions (consciousness evolution)
- Sapphire blue accents (celestial harmony)

Style: Sacred geometry meets cosmic abstraction, reminiscent of Schwaller de Lubicz's temple symbolism
Mood: Transcendent unity, mathematical perfection, esoteric wisdom
Composition: Mandala-like symmetry with dynamic spiral evolution

Inspired by The Temple of Man - the unity of all existence expressed through number, symbol, and harmony.
