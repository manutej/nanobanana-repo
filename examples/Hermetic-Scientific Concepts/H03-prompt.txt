Create a mystical symbolic visualization titled "SPIRITUS DOMINI FEREBATUR SUPER AQUAS - Spirit Moving Upon Waters"

Visual Elements:
- Primordial waters below: dark, formless, infinite potential (tohu wa-bohu)
- Divine breath/wind above: luminous spiraling force (Ruach Elohim)
- Interface between spirit and matter: shimmering membrane where creation begins
- Subtle light emerging from darkness (Fiat Lux - "Let there be light")
- Dove symbolism descending (traditional pneuma/spirit representation)
- Wave patterns showing harmonic resonance - spirit vibrating matter into form
- Hebrew letters emerging from the interface (Logos/Word taking form)
- Cosmic egg cracking - birth of manifest reality

Color Palette:
- Deep primordial blacks and indigos (unmanifest waters)
- Brilliant whites and golds (divine spirit/light)
- Iridescent transitions (spirit-matter interface)
- Subtle rainbow refractions (light differentiating into spectrum)
- Twilight blues and purples (liminal creation moment)

Style: Cosmic mysticism meets creation imagery - Genesis visualization
Mood: Primordial mystery, divine immanence, creative power
Composition: Horizontal division with dynamic interaction at boundary

"And the Spirit of the LORD moved upon the face of the waters" - the moment before creation, pure potential awaiting divine touch.
